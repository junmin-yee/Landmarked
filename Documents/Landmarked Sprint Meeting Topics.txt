refactoring into a single landmark class that will be used consistently - decorator?

get everyone on the same page and understanding of what our gui is going to do. Seems like we're all picturing something different

consider having a person go back and start testing

Showing Landmarks - how do we want this exactly?
How is the User going to filter landmarks?
How is the user going to initiate a landmark search and how are results displayed?
Discussion on What is classified a Landmark? (Need to maintain a "list" of items for API filtering)
Ideas on how to deal with with limited api results returned when there are many Landmarks in an area
Are we going to allow the user to turn around (as if taking a panorama) and dynamically serve(and unserve) landmark information?
